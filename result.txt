1. The pool of strings in Java is maintained for saving space and for faster comparisons.
String Interning is a method of storing only one copy of each distinct String Value, which must be immutable.
It helps in the taskto store many similar strings.
2. Links for each line and substring also need some space. Redefinition of variables helps to save free heap space.
3. For this reasons value of used memory decreased from 8MB to 7KB
